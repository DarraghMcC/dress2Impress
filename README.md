Simple rest app which tells if you need a jacket or not

### What is this ###

Simple Rest App built with:
* Java
* maven 
* spring boot


### What does it do ###

Check a basic weather api and tells if you need to wear a jacket or not based on temerature threshold. 


### Is that it?? ###

Eh, yeah for now. The idea is to expand this way further, have a whole range of weather conditions catered for, as well as a DB for different clothes available to the user.
